# This python code is to be uploaded onto the Raspberry Pi PICO, ultimately turning it into a state machine.

# In State One, the PICO must be blinking its LED once per second, supplying instructions via morse code through GP2 for the detective to supply 5V
# to GP5, and then reading for 5V supplied at the GP5 pin.

# In State Two, the PICO must be blinking its LED twice every 0.8 seconds, supplying instructions via morse code through GP7 for the detective to
# supply 5V at the GP9 pin, and then reading for 5V supplied at the GP9 pin.

# In State Three, the PICO must be blinking its LED thrice per 0.6 seconds, supplying instructions via morse code through GP12 for the detective to
# supply 5V at the GP13 pin, and then reading for 5V supplied at the GP13 pin.

# In State Solved, the PICO must be blinking its LED rapidly and continuously, sending a message out its USB port at 115200 bps that says,
